# beyond_the_score
A reflection on perfectionism sparked by a B, and a step toward building value beyond grades.

### 📌 Background & Motivation

This past semester, I received two B grades in core major courses, while many of my peers achieved straight As. It led me into a spiral of self-doubt. I started to question my abilities and even considered giving up entirely. I believed I simply wasn't as capable as others — that I wasn't “cut out” for academia, and that I had lost my chance of ever setting foot in a world-class university, something I had dreamed of for years.

With no one to confide in, I felt lost, disappointed, and helpless.  
In an attempt to manage the anxiety, I began having conversations with AI. Surprisingly, it helped. It allowed me to step back and reevaluate my thinking around perfectionism and academic validation.

For a long time, I equated worth with high grades and being “better” than others. This mindset is still difficult to fully unlearn — but I'm beginning to shift my focus.

What truly matters is multidimensional growth.

I am currently working on a research project, which I now see as one of the most valuable opportunities to apply what I’ve learned in a meaningful way. Instead of fixating on grades, I want to transform what I know into real output — into questions, products, insights, and impact. I want to move beyond the score.

This project is not meant to prove how excellent I am.  
It’s a documentation of the moment I stopped measuring myself solely by numbers and started building from within.

Without those two Bs, I may never have started asking the right questions.

In hindsight, it wasn’t failure — it was a turning point.

This repository marks the beginning of my attempt to explore, build, and understand more deeply.  
I hope to record that process here, step by step — not in pursuit of perfection, but in pursuit of growth, clarity, and self-defined value.

_This reflection is personal, but I believe sharing the journey can be as important as the destination._
